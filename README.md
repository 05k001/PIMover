# PIMover
A Bash Script to move files from a thumb drive to a folder on the pi

We are going to use the UDEV daemon to wait for a specific thumb drive to be plugged into the pi. Then it will invoke the script that moves all the files from a specific folder on the thumbdrive on to a hard drive mounted on the pi.
